# University Evaluation Windows Phone


# *!!!! This Project is under construction and not ready to use !!!!* 


This project presents a software solution of the evaluation
problem faced by universities.  The software
features automated processing of given answers, independency
of location, a flexible data model supporting multiple questionnaires
and an interface designed to be used effectively upon first
encounter. While our approach aims to support a high participation
rate of the evaluations it is currently tested in a live environment
to see if it reaches this goal.
